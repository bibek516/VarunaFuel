# Reflection

This project highlighted how AI-assisted development can improve productivity while still requiring human judgment and engineering discipline.

### What AI Helped With
- Generating boilerplate code (React components, Prisma models, Express routes)
- Debugging dependency errors quickly
- Clarifying business rules from FuelEU regulations

### Where Human Thinking Was Required
- Designing a **Hexagonal Architecture** to maintain separation of concerns
- Ensuring compliance balance formulas were correct
- Making sure pooling and banking rules did not violate regulatory constraints
- Testing API correctness and UI state transitions

### Efficiency Gains
- Development was approximately **2–3× faster** due to AI support
- Code consistency improved by letting AI handle repetitive scaffolding

### Future Improvements
- Add authentication & role-based access
- Add vessel analytics & historical CB charts
- Containerize the entire system with Docker + CI pipelines
